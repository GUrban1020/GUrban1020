- 👋 Hi, I’m @GUrban1020

- 👀 I’m interested in Videogames and Game Design

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Game Development! I graduated with a BA in Game Development, majored in programming - and I'm actively in the middle of a MA for programming as well!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Nothing for now, as I'm trying to focus on my learning and getting better at what I do.

- 📫 How to reach me? You can find all my links in my linktree - https://linktr.ee/thelivingrequiem - which includes several of my social media and my portfolio. 
You may certainly contact me from any of those locations.
